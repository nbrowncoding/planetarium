Mercury is the smallest planet (excluding dwarf planets) in our solar system. It’s a little bigger than Earth’s Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun. The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 to 700 K (−173 to 427 °C; −280 to 800 °F) at the most extreme places, but it’s actually not the hottest. On the dark side of the planet, temperatures average 110 K (-163 °C; -262 °F). It has a thin atmosphere composed of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K).

Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. This means that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.

Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. Mercury does not have a moon.
